# Introduction

knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/qiime2_supplement.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
``` 

This bookdown is a supplement to the main one. It contains some workflows and tools that are not part of the core QIIME2 workflow. However, they may prove useful depending on your needs.

The sections in this supplement will cover:

- Exporting QIIME2 artifacts to text files.
- Handy QIIME2 commands
- Carrying our functional prediction with a taxonomy abundance table.
- Introduction to some R packages for 16S rRNA analysis.

Ensure you have the QIIME2 environment activated for all of these materials. For convenience the command is:

```{bash eval=FALSE}
. useqiime2-2021.2
```
