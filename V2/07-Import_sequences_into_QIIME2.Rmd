# Sequence import
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/import.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
``` 

Now it is time to import our read pairs into a QIIME2 artifact.

__Note__: It is quite easy to make typos in the following command. Ensure to read any errors carefully to try to figure out where a typo is, if any.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
qiime tools import --type 'SampleData[PairedEndSequencesWithQuality]' \
 --input-path PairedEndFastqManifestPhred33.csv \
 --output-path paired-end-demux.qza \
 --input-format PairedEndFastqManifestPhred33
```
 
This command will use the information contained in the ‘manifest file’ to create the ‘paired-end-demux.qza’. 

The "demux" part of the file name indicates that the samples are already demultiplexed (i.e. sequences have benn sperarated by samples). Additonally, QIIME2 artifacts use "-" as word seperators in file names.  This is not mandatory but it is a good practice to keep consistent with the QIIME2 developers.

To visualise the samples loaded, the following command will create a visualisation artifact.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
qiime demux summarize --i-data paired-end-demux.qza \
--o-visualization paired-end-demux.qzv
```

__Chrome__

This next step is important! Make sure to open a new terminal and open chrome in it. Keep this terminal and chrome open (To open a new terminal, right click on the main screen, choose `Applications` -> `Shell` -> `bash`). Opening and closing chrome multiple times has proven to cause issues in past workshops. To open the browser ‘chrome’, run:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
chrome.sh
```

Form now on leave the terminal you ran the above command on alone.

Then:

- Type the following web-site: ‘view.qiime2.org’
- Click on ‘Drag and drop or click here’ grey box
- You can browse now to find and select the file ‘paired-end-demux.qzv’. Tip: click "HOME" on the top right, from there you can navigate to "Metagenetics" and choose your file.

The visulaisation will have two tabs:

1. __Overview__: This contains 3 main sections relating to the sequence count of samples.
   - __Demultiplexxed sequence counts summary__: Summary table of number of sequences per sample divided by forward and reverse reads.
   - __Read frequency histograms__: Forward and Reverse reads histograms showing the how many samples have various numbers of sequences. 
   - __Per-sample sequence counts__: Table showing the number of forward and reverse reads in samples.
2. __Interactive Quality Plots__: Contains similar information as fastQC analysis.
   - __Interactive quality plots__: These show the quality of your forward and reverse reads using a random smapling of 10000 reads. You can click on a part of the plot to get info in the below "Paramteric seven-number summary" table.
   - __Demultiplexed sequence length summary__: Table showing summary of sequence lengths for the forward and reverse reads.

__Questions__: 

- Are the sequences evenly distributed across samples?
- Which sample has the lowest number of sequences? 
- Is there any sample with a low final number of sequences (<20k)? 
- What is the mean sequence count per sample?
- How is the overall quality for the sequences?
