## Workflow

The 'QIIME2' analysis workflow comprises of nine steps:

1. Import sequences into QIIME2 artifact
2. Trim the PCR primer sequences
3. De-novo amplicon sequence variants identifications
4. Assign a taxonomic classification to each ASV
5. Make a phylogenetic tree of the identified ASVs
6. Sequencing depth evaluation: rarefaction plot
7. Sequencing controls evaluation: beta-diversity without normalisation
8. Diversity analysis: alpha and beta
9. Differential abundance analysis of ASVs across different conditions
