Alpha diversity is a representation of the diversity within a sample. There are many possible metrics for estimating alpha diversity (QIIME2 allows 30 metrics to be estimated), including the “Shannon” metric, the number of observed features and Faith’s phylogenetic distance (Shannon,
1948, Faith, 1992).

Beta diversity is diversity among different communities. There are many possible metrics to represent the distance among samples (QIIME2 allows 34 to be estimated). We will use weighted and unweighted UniFrac metrics (Lozupone and Knight, 2005, Lozupoune et al., 2007) and the Bray-Curtis metric (Bray and Curtis, 1957) (More info on these mertics in the appendix).

## Core metrics command

QIIME2 includes a wrapper script to co-investigate alpha- and beta-diversity at the same time. This script includes only a selected list of alpha- and beta-diversity metrics, but these are usually enough to investigate the dataset. It is possible to use different metrics using the single scripts for alpha and beta-diversity (https://docs.qiime2.org/2019.1/plugins/available/diversity/).

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
qiime diversity core-metrics-phylogenetic \
--i-table table-dada2.qza \
--i-phylogeny rooted-tree.qza \
# Chosen final sampling depth
--p-sampling-depth 34583 \
--output-dir dada2-diversity-34583 \
--m-metadata-file metadata.file.txt
```

This command will produce all the results within the directory specified with the option `--output-dir`. The produced artifact `rarefied_table.qza` is the abundance table normalised by rarefaction at the specified sampling size. The output directory contains artifacts for each used diversity metrics (for alpha- and beta-diversity). The beta-diversity ordination plots are also included in visualisation objects (`emperor.qzv` files).

In case of ITS or any marker for which it is not possible to obtain phylogenetic tree, the alternative command to use for the diversity analysis is: `qiime diversity core-metrics`, which lacks the
`--i-phylogeny` option.

__Questions__: 

+ Looking at the beta-diversity plot (`emperor.qzv`), one metric of your choice, is there any metadata category that produces clusters based on the groups? NOte: You can reorientate the 3D plot.
+ If you choose a different metric, do you get a different plot/results?
+ Does a different sampling-depth give a different result? Try running the `core-metrics-phylogenetic` command with a different `--p-sampling-depth` and `--output-dir`.

## Alpha diveristy statistical analysis

We can carry out some statistical analysis to determine if difference between the alpha diversity values in metadata groups is significantly significant.

The QIIME2 pipeline offers two alternative choices: 

- Categorical data: Kruskal-Wallis test.
- Numerical data: Ranked Spearman test.

As we have catergorical and numeric metadata columns we will carry out both types of test. Let us do this for the shannon alpha diversity.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
#Change directory into the output directory
cd dada2-diversity-34583
# For the Kruskal-Wallis test
qiime diversity alpha-group-significance \
--i-alpha-diversity shannon_vector.qza \
--m-metadata-file ../metadata.file.txt \
--o-visualization shannon-group-significance.kw.qzv
# For the ranked Spearman test
qiime diversity alpha-correlation \
--i-alpha-diversity shannon_vector.qza \
--m-metadata-file ../metadata.file.txt \
--o-visualization shannon-group-significance.rs.qzv
```

Load the produced files into QIIME2 view. At this point I will remind you to have only one chrome window open which is to be left open. Also make sure to close tabs you don't need any more (always leaving one open).

In the visualisations you will see plots showing the diversity values and statistics below the plots. You can choose what metadata grouping to visualise with the __Column__ drop down selection. To determine if there is a statistical difference between the groups:

- Kruskal-Wallis: It is best to look at the q-value/s (in essence the p-value corrected) in the pairwise section. The q-value is in essence the multiple comparison corrected p-value. As there is only one comparison in each of the 2 categorical metadata groupings the q-value is the same as the p-value (no multiple testing carried out).
- Ranked Spearman: Can look at the p-value to determine is there is a statistical significant correlation between the numeric category and the alpha diversity metric.

__Questions__:

+ Are there any groups (for one or more metadata __Column__) showing a higher/lower alpha-diversity compared to the other/s in the same __Column__? 
+ Is the p-value or q-value for this comparison significant? 
+ If you choose a different metric do you get different results? Run both the Kruskal-Wallis and Ranked Spearman tests on a alpha diveristy metric of your choice and visualise the results.

## Beta diversity statistical analysis

Next we can carry out statistical analysis of the beta diversity ordination plots. We will carry out a 'PRMANOVA' analysis to determine if the separation of samples by metadata groups has statistical significance or if it may have just be originated by chance. 

To carry this out the 'PERMANOVA' analysis we will use the `distance_matrix.qza` which contains all the sample pairwise dissimilarity distances. For the `--p-permutations` option we will use the default value, 999.

The 'Location' metadata column with the weighted UniFrac metric will be used as there appeared to be a separation between the Corridor and Toilet samples, especially on Axis 2.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
qiime diversity beta-group-significance \
--i-distance-matrix weighted_unifrac_distance_matrix.qza \
--m-metadata-file ../metadata.file.txt \
--m-metadata-column Location \
# prmanova default, anosim as alternative choice
--p-method permanova \
--p-pairwise \
--p-permutations 999 \
--o-visualization weighted-unifrac-significance.location.qzv
```

Load the resulting visualisation file in QIIME2 view. You will see the following sections:

- __Overview__: An overview of the statistical analysis for the metadata column.
- __Group significance plot__: These boxplots represent all the pairwise distances between the samples in the specified groups.
   - Distances to Corridor plot
      - Corridor boxplot: This boxplot represents all the pairwise distances within the Corridor samples. If you had 3 corridor samples (C1-3) the boxplot would consist of the distances between C1-C2, C1-C3, and C2-C3.
      - Toilet boxplot: This boxplot represents the pairwise distances between all the corridor samples and toilet samples. If you had 3 corridor samples (C1-3) and 2 toilet samples (T1-2) the boxplot would consist of the distances between C1-T1, C1-T2, C2-T1, C2-T2, C3-T1, and C3-T2.
   - With these plots you can see if the distances within a group is lower than the distances between that group and other groups.
- __Pairwise results__: This section shows the statistical results comparing the different groups in pairwise fashion. The best values to look at are:
   - Sample size: Good to determine if there are enough samples for statistical strength.
   - q-value: Always go for q-values over p-values.

__Questions__:

+ Does the chosen grouping information result in a statistical significance differences? 
+ Does using ‘anosim’ instead of ‘permanova’ change the result? 
+ And using a different ordination metric? 
+ What about choosing a different grouping (metadata category)?
