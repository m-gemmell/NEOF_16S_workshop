This can be done in several ways. A common approach is high-throughput amplicon sequencing, usually of a region of the bacterial 16S SSU rRNA gene. Another approach is shotgun metagenomic sequencing, where the whole genomic content of a sample is sequenced. In the first approach, amplicons act as tags identifying the different bacterial species present in the sample, which can be both identified and quantified to describe the composition of the bacterial community (also called metagenetics or metaprofiling). In the second approach, whole genomes, rather than just representative amplicons, are sequenced (shotgun metagenomics). This DNA can be assembled, or the source of the reads can be identified and quantified in a broadly similar way to 16S analysis. In this workshop, we will analyse amplicon sequencing data, obtained by amplification of the variable region 4 of the 16S gene, using primer 515FB-806RB described in http://press.igsb.anl.gov/earthmicrobiome/protocols-and-standards/16s/ (Caporaso et al, 2011). The sequences were obtained from the Illumina MiSeq platform, 2x250bp reads, and the analysis process will be based on the software package QIIME2 (Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology, https://qiime2.org). We will explore the bacterial populations sampled at various locations in the Bioscience building: toilets and corridors from different floors. 2.1 16S rRNA 16S ribosomal RNA is a structural RNA which is a component of the prokaryotic ribosome. Ribosomes are the site of protein synthesis, therefore all prokaryotes have at least a 16S rRNA gene that codes for the 16S ribosomal RNA. The 16S rRNA gene is utilised in reconstructing phylogenies due to its slow rate of evolution, its size and its functional constancy. If the function of 16S rRNA changed then the cell could not synthesise protein correctly and so will not survive. The 16S rRNA gene is ~1,500bp long and is made up of 9 variable regions separated by conserved regions. The variable regions evolve at a faster rate allowing differentiation between bacterial taxa. The conserved regions evolve at a slower rate which allows areas to carry out universal amplification on the gene. The nine variable regions are generally called V1, V2, V3 etc. Secondary structure of 16S rRNA of Esherichia coli (Yarza et al, 2014) 2.2 ITS and other possible marker genes It is very common to perform analysis with marker genes other than 16S, e.g. to study communities of fungi, insects or any other eukaryote species. From the perspective of the bioinformatics analysis, the same overall pipeline can be used for most of the marker genes. ITS (Internal Transcribed Spacer) is a commonly used marker alternative to 16S. QIIME2 can be used to analyse ITS with a few steps and commands required which are unnecessary for 16S rRNA data. In this tutorial, locations will be highlighted where you should consider a pipeline variation if you are using ITS. In general, we recommend searching the literature so you can be aware of the state-of-the-art methods for the analysis of your marker of interest. 2.3 Amplicon sequencing The use of high-throughput amplicon-sequencing has proven to be powerful and accurate for microbial community analysis. It is currently the preferred choice used to investigate biological communities (bacterial or eukaryotic) in many samples and conditions. Some of the reasons for this methods popularity are: It is relatively easy to perform. It can be performed with many samples. It is relatively fast and cheap. On the negative side, there are many steps which may potentially introduce biases in the final result: Experimental design, sampling, storage and DNA extraction methods are known to potentially reduce the initial bacterial population processed and sequenced. Any reagent used may add exogenous bacterial population to the samples (potentially contaminating or changing the initial bacterial amount). Several papers discuss how the PCR protocol used for the amplification of the DNA material may affect the final results (such as the creation of chimeric sequences or by preferentially amplifying some bacterial). The choice of sequencing platform may result in the identification of different species in the same samples by having its own characteristic error-profile. From the bioinformatics perspective, the length of the sequences, and the pipeline used for the analysis are also able to add variability to the final results. The identification of the species in the samples can be affected by the quality and completeness of the database used for the analysis. Additionally, it may become less precise at lower taxonomy levels such as genus and species (Hugerth and Andersson, 2017). All these aspects need to be taken into account in the discussion of the results. Above shows a representation of amplicon sequencing. Different species are shown as different colours, with the indication of which species are in the site under investigation. Some species may be excluded from the sequencing because they are: Missed by the sampling methods (purple dots) Lost during the sample preparation (outside green square) Lost by the extraction technique (outside green square) Not amplified in the PCR step (outside red square) Representation of the number of sequences obtained for a sample, showing that increasing the number of sequences increases the probability to retrieve low-abundant species in the samples. The main purpose for this analysis is to infer the number and type of species in the initial sampling site by the abundance of the sequences obtained by the sequencing experiment. In order to do this effectively, the use of mock communities and negative controls is strongly suggested to evaluate the effect of any possibly introduced bias. Additionally, normalisation of the data is absolutely necessary to compare the diversity between sample groups.

The QIIME1 scripts, in its latest release QIIME1.9.1, are still available (and their methods are still valid) however the suggestion is to use QIIME2, as QIIME1 is no longer supported. In the following practical we will use the QIIME2 released on February 2021 (given the active development on the tool this may not be the most recent release at the time of this workshop). To install QIIME2, please refer to its instruction page: https://docs.qiime2.org/2021.2/install/ 3.1 Artifacts The QIIME2 pipeline produces and uses artifact files. These contain data and metadata and may be of two types: result or visualisation. Result files (.qza): This file type contains the results of a method, which accepts other artifacts and specific settings as input, in order to apply a procedure creating a new artifact (e.g. loading sequences, error correction, alpha- or beta-diversity). Visualisation files (.qzv): This file type contains the results of a specific procedure to obtain an object that can only be used to visualize the results. These files can be loaded into the following web-site https://view.qiime2.org, where the interactive visualisations can be viewed. Please note that only chrome and Firefox are supported by this QIIME2 website. 3.2 Workflow The steps for the analysis are listed below, mainly taken from https://docs.qiime2.org/2019.1/tutorials/. Representation of the step proposed for the analysis (http://compbio.ucsd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/20170712_microbiome_16s_tutorial_non-interactive.pdf) Prepare the sequence dataset Remove PCR primers Amplicon Sequence Variants identification Assign a taxonomic classification to each AVS Train naive-classifier for assignment Taxonomy assignment of the identified ASVs Make a phylogeny tree for the ASVs Alignment of the identified ASV Masking low quality alignment Creating the un-rooted phylogenetic tree Creating the rooted phylogenetic tree Summarise the taxonomy data for each sample and plot results Estimate and plot alpha diversity Estimate and plot beta diversity Differential abundance analysis 3.3 Prepare the sequence dataset The read set you will be using in this tutorial will be a raw dataset. It still includes low quality sequences, Illumina sequencing adapters as well as PCR primers. Before proceeding with the analysis, it is a good strategy to investigate the quality of the sequences. The PCR primers used for the amplification may have degenerate positions (required for annealing to the large variety of species in the samples). This adds random variability outside the target region. These unknown sequences may affect the subsequent taxonomy identification as well as the error-correction step. We will use Cutadapt to remove the PCR primers before any other step. If the analysis is based on a marker gene different than 16S, other quality trimming may be required. In the case of the ITS marker gene, the common practice is to trim off the conserved regions (SSU, 5.8S or LSU) that may be contained in the final amplicon. The ITSxpress software (Rivers et al., 2018) is designed for this specific task and it is available as a QIIME2 plug-in, though it requires specific installation steps because it is not installed with the basic (core) installation process. It could be found among the list of third-party QIIME2 available plug-ins (https://library.qiime2.org/plugins/ ). 3.4 Amplicon Sequence Variants identification The key element of this type of metagenomic analysis is the identification of the different rRNA variants in the sample. 3.4.1 OTUs The most used procedure to identify OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Units) is through the clustering of reads into groups that are sufficiently similar to one another. These grouped reads are likely to come from the same rRNA gene, genome or taxa group. The identified OTUs are a feature of the sequence dataset, heavily dependent on the similarity level used for OTU identification. The most commonly used threshold is 3% dissimilarity (i.e 97% similarity) to group reads into species OTUS. Therefore, de novo OTUs identified in two different data sets cannot be compared. There is no single perfect tool for this step; but a few of the most widely used are: UCLUST (the default used by QIIME1.9.1) VSEARCH CD-Hit SWARM (if you work with QIIME1.9.1 we recommend using SWARM for this step) The number of reads in each OTU should reflect the number of copies of the gene in the sample, thus providing a quantitative measure of diversity. 3.4.2 ASVs There are now many bioinformatics methods to resolve amplicon sequence variants (AVS) from Illumina data. These methods do not impose the arbitrary dissimilarity thresholds that define molecular OTUs. The two methods available in QIIME2 are DADA2 and deblur. ASV methods infer the biological sequences in the sample prior to the introduction of amplification and sequencing errors, and distinguish sequence variants differing by as little as one nucleotide. The methods use a de novo process in which biological sequences are discriminated from errors on the basis of, in part, the expectation that biological sequences are more likely to be repeatedly observed than error-containing sequences. Unlike de novo OTUs, ASVs are consistent labels because ASVs represent a biological reality that exists outside of the data being analysed: the DNA sequence of the assayed organism. Thus, ASVs inferred independently from different studies or different samples can be validly compared. The following picture (http://ju.outofmemory.cn/entry/332219) shows how DADA2 (an ASV method) and OTU processes compare each other. This shows how the canonical creation of OTUs creation by clustering may lead to an overestimation of the size of the OTUs due to the presence of errors, from either PCR or sequencing. Much of the work involved in analysis of amplicon-based metagenomic data is that of separating true variants from errors introduced by sequencing. These errors include miscalling of nucleotides and the generation of chimeric sequences. For sequencing purposes, an aliquot of PhiX phage DNA is added to each sample before sequencing, both DADA2 and deblur include a step aimed to exclude any PhiX associated reads. To remove PCR chimeric artefacts, a further filter step is applied by both. QIIME 2 Authors suggest using DADA2 for read pairs and deblur for already paired (stitched/joined) sequences. Please note that it is good practice to remove/trim out sequences containing Ns before the error correction step. It is not suggested to denoise with DADA2 samples from different sequencing lanes, because each lane may introduce different sequencing bias. It is possible to collate the denoised abundance tables and representative sequences afterward, recording the sequencing lane for each sample in a specific metadata column. The deblur denoise tool may be used in this case because it should be less sensitive to these possible biases, however it is good practice to keep the lane of origin in the metadata (with the second benefit that deblur is also faster than DADA2). 3.5 Assign a taxonomic classification to each ASV The sequence of each ASV is compared with the selected database, to identify the most likely taxonomy for each ASV. Unfortunately different parts of the taxonomic identification step may lead to different results for the same ASV. Different databases may result in different taxonomic classification for the same ASV. The choice of tool used for taxonomic assignment may also impact the results in a similar way. The current version of QIIME2 allows you to select from either the Scikit-learn classifier (a classifier which applies a machine learning approach and therefore needs training before use) or BLAST+ and VSEARCH (for a global alignment approach followed by a last common ancestor search) for this step. In the practical we will use Scikit-learn (similar to the RDP tool widely used so far). It has been shown that (at least in the case of 16S analysis) taxonomic classification accuracy improves when the classifier is trained with sequences derived from the amplicon region only (Werner et al., 2012). 3.6 Build phylogenetic tree To include phylogenetic diversity metrics in the diversity analysis, such as UniFrac distance metric, the construction of a phylogenetic tree for the identified AVS previously identified is required. QIIME2 supports MAFFT for the alignment and MASK to mask the alignment sections that are not phylogenetically informative. Unrooted and rooted trees may be created. For some marker genes it is not possible to build phylogenetic tree (ITS is among these), and it is therefore important to know the properties of the marker in use. Consequently, it is not possible to use any diversity metrics that requires the phylogenetic distance as input. 3.7 Data normalisation Any further analyses to compare the identified ASVs among sample groups (either alpha- or beta-diversity or differential abundance) should account for the features of the abundance table that can cause erroneous results (Weiss et al., 2017). These features are: The microbial community in each sample may be represented by different numbers of sequences (i.e. sequencing depth for each sample). The abundance table is usually sparse. That is, most of the ASVs are present only in a few samples and therefore the abundance table contains many 0 values (it is also possible that a particular species is present in a sample but below the detection limit of the methods). The total number of sequences obtained reflect the relative abundance of species sequenced rather that the absolute abundance of the species present in the sample (this is commonly referred as compositional nature of the data). The relative abundances for the taxa are therefore not independent as in the underlying assumption of many frequently used statistical methods (Gloor et al., 2017). A normalisation step for the data is required to mitigate these effects and to allow an easier data interpretation. The most used normalisation methods are: Normalisation by rarefaction. This is performed by reducing all the samples at the same sequence count, by random sub-sampling of the sequences. This method may lead to a potential reduction of the species in your dataset (alpha-diversity) and to the exclusion of any samples not reaching the selected total count per sample. DESeq method (borrowed from transcriptomic research) Scaling the abundance table by a fixed value or proportion. Applying a log-ratio transformation proposed by Aitchinson (1982) in analogy of compositional dataset. This is aimed to convert the abundance data into scales on which it is possible to apply conventional statistical procedures. Methods b-d convert the abundance table in a normalised-abundance table with different strength and pitfalls, therefore they can affect results for beta-diversity and differentially abundant analysis. These normalisation methods were compared by Weiss and colleagues (2017), but their simulations show that different methods may result in different sensitivity and different false discovery rates. In this tutorial, following the QIIME2 current tutorial, we will apply the following normalisation methods: The rarefaction method, in the context of the alpha- and beta-diversity analysis. The centered log-ratio transformation (clr-transformation) method, in the context of the differential abundance analysis. 3.8 Alpha-diversity Alpha-diversity is used to measure the diversity within a sample. It is calculated as a value for each sample. Different metrics were developed to calculate diversity in different ways. It combines richness (a measure of the number of species in the sample) and evenness (a measure of the relative abundance of different species that make up the richness of that sample). Alpha diversity measures cannot be compared unless they have been normalised for the difference in sequencing depth between samples. The QIIME2 release we will use supports the following alpha-diversity measures, amongst others: Chao1, Shannon, Simpson, Simpson evenness, Faiths Phylogenetic Diversity (the only one considering the phylogenetic relationships among the ASVs). The alpha-diversity metric used for the analysis must be chosen carefully, considering its mathematical definition in relation of the behaviour of the tools used for the previous steps. An important point to consider is whether the chosen metric uses ASVs with only 1 sequence (singletons) to perform some estimation on the dataset or not. The Chao1, as one example for this, uses the number of singletons in the dataset to infer the total number of singletons in the population. However, the DADA2 denoising step excludes singletons from the final output, making Chao1 measures not applicable to its resulting abundance tables. A second consideration regards if the phylogenetic tree is available enabling the use of the Faiths Phylogenetic Diversity metric, for markers such as ITS this metric would not be possible. 3.9 Beta-diversity Beta-diversity is a term for the comparison of samples to each other. It is also referred as beta-diversity ordination, because it uses one (or more) technique/s to arrange samples along axes on the basis of their composition to highlight the differences. The current QIIME2 release supports only the Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) method to investigate beta-diversity (within the old QIIME1 pipeline you could perform nMDS as well). The starting point of the analysis is a dissimilarity matrix, which is used to perform a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimension for display purpose. The axes obtained from the PCA analysis are then compared with the categories in the metadata file to identify patterns. A few of the commonly used beta diversity metrics supported by QIIME2 are: Jaccard: A non-phylogeny based method that takes into account only presence/absence of a ASVs to measure the distance between two samples. Bray-Curtis: A non-phylogeny based method that takes into account the number of ASVs as well as their abundance while measuring the distance between two samples. Un-weighted UniFrac: Uses the presence and absence of ASVs and phylogenies. Weighted UniFrac: Uses the abundance information of ASVs and phylogenies. As discussed for the alpha-diversity, before proceeding with the beta-diversity analysis the raw abundance table for the identified ASVs needs to be normalised, to this QIIME2 suggests using the rarefaction methods, in particular at the same rarefaction threshold used for the alpha diversity. The choice of the beta-diversity distance metric to use will strongly affect the results, it therefore common practice to compare the results obtained with different metrics. Again, not all the metrics may be applicable to all the marker genes, for example the UniFrac distances could not be easily used in the case of ITS, because ITS sequences are quite difficult to align onto phylogenetic trees. 3.10 Differential Abundance Analysis The identification of taxa that are differentially abundant across experimental conditions may be an important result for many types of metagenetics analyses. This step is extremely dependent on the normalization methods used to compare the samples: using different normalisation methods may lead to different results (consequently this is another active area of research). QIIME2 supports two normalisation methods to investigate differentially abundant taxa across experimental conditions: ANCOM (Mandal et al., 2015) and GNEISS (Morton et al, 2017). Both methods are based on the conversion of the abundance values using the clr-transformation method prior to any comparison. Because the conversion is based on a logarithmic transformation, all the value in the abundance table will be increased by 1 to avoid 0 counts (pseudo-counts). These methods may therefore artificially increase the alpha-diversity for the samples as well as decrease the beta-diversity distances in the dataset. In this analysis we will use the ANCOM method following the current QIIME2 tutorial. This method computes the log-ratio for every possible pair of the identified taxa (using the mean group values for the clr-transformed abundance) and reports how many times the hypothesis H 0 = X is not differentially abundant is rejected for each taxa X. That is the W statistics, the higher this value is the more significant the ASV/taxa X is differentially abundant between the tested groups. This test assumes that a large number of ASVs did not change in abundances between groups. If, in the results, more than 25% of the ASVs changes in the examined contrasts, the underlying hypothesis for the ANCOM test may be not fulfilled, and there is the chance that the results may be misleading. Examples of questions to answer: Are there differences in taxa at various levels of taxonomy? What are the most abundant ASVs (or species)? What are the rare ASVs present (either real or still retained sequencing error)? Where are the rare ASVs present (if not sequencing error)? ASVs correlation: is there a correlation between ASVs and other attributes of samples, like pH or other environmental conditions?

This choice is based on the quality across the length of the read (looking for when quality dips) plus the total length of our V4 amplicon.

This may be one of the longest steps of the whole pipeline. The running time is proportional to the complexity of the sequences (how many ASVs are in the dataset) and to the quality of the sequences (how many errors are present). If this step is taking too long in one of your future projects, you may try to use deblur to de-noise your data (after joining the reads with vsearch), which is generally faster. In the case of a marker gene with very variable amplicon sequence lengths, as in the case of ITS amplicon sequencing, a possible alternative denoising strategy is to disable the filtering by truncation length using the options: --p-trunc-len-f 0 and --p-trunc-len-r 0. To exclude the low quality tails the --p-trunc-q 20 option is now required, this option will trim all the sequences after the first base with quality below 20 (this may be very stringent, so you may want to try with lower values as well). A further possibility may be to use only either the forward or reverse read file, for this the qiime dada2 denoise-single should be use instead the above dada2 command. 9.2 Visualise DADA2 output 9.2.1 table-dada2.qzv To visualise information on the ASV table we will run: qiime feature-table summarize \\ --i-table table-dada2.qza \\ --o-visualization table-dada2.qzv \\ --m-sample-metadata-file metadata.file.txt Now load the obtained table-dada2.qzv into the view.qiime2.org website.

The page opened with table-dada2.qzv contains 3 tabs: Overview: An overview page with various information. Table summary Number of samples Number of features: In this case features are ASVs. If this was a taxa table features would be the number of taxa. Total frequency: Total number of sequences (i.e. total abundance across all samples and ASVs). Frequency per sample: Summary of number of sequences. IQR table: Table showing the Interquartile range of sample frequencies. Histogram of frequency per sample: This gives a rough view as the start and end of the histogram is based on the minimum and maximum sample frequencies. The vertical dark blue lines on the x axis represent the specific frequencies of samples (1 vertical line per sample). Frequency per feature: Summary of number of sequences per feature (ASV/taxa). IQR table: Table showing the Interquartile range of feature frequencies. Histogram of frequency per sample: This shows a rough view of the number of features (y axis) with different frequencies (x axis). Note that the scales are logarithmic. The left side of the plot shows how many rare ASVs there are (ASVs represented by a low amount of sequences, i.e. low abundance ASVs). The right side of the plot shows the amount of high abundance ASVs. Interactive Sample Detail: This interactive section allows you to explore sampling depth. Experiment using the Plot Controls. Plot: This shows the number of samples per metadata category. Feature count table: Table showing feature count per sample. Plot Controls: Controls to change and update the plot and table. Save as..: Controls to save the current plot. Metadata Category: This allows you to change the values on the x axis of the plot. Sampling Depth: Choosing a sampling depth will update the following. Plot: The plot will be updated to grey out the tops of the bars by removing samples with a depth lower than the chosen sampling depth. Feature count table: Samples with a lower depth than the sampling depth will be highlighted red. Plot Controls: Below the controls is a section of text showing the number of features and samples reatined by the chosen sampling depth. Feature detail: This is a table with 3 columns. 1st column: This is the ASV id. This ID represnets the exact amplicon sequence variant. This is useful as if this ASV id is in another sequencing experiment it means they are identical between the two studies. This allows for easy merging of multiple ASV tables. Frequency: Number of sequences representing the ASV acorss all samples. I.e. the total abundance of the ASV. # of Samples Observed in: Number of samples the ASVs was detected in. Questions: How many ASVs were detected in the dataset? What is the median and mean number of sequences per samples (to 1 decimal place)? What is the minimum and maximum number of sequences per ASV? How many samples have &gt;100,000 sequences? Are there more Corridor samples or Toilet samples (based on Location metadata category)?

Open the dada2-stats.qzv visualisation with QIIME2 view. You will now see a denoising stats table with the following columns: sample-id input: Number of sequence pairs the sample started with prior to the denoising steps. filtered: Number of sequence pairs retained after user specified filtering (e.g. --p-trunc-len-f 220 will truncate forward reads but alos remove sequence pairs where the forward length is shorter than 220). percentage of input passed filter: Percentage of input reads that passed the filtering step. denoised: Number of filtered sequence pairs that were successfully denoised. merged: Number of filtered and denoised paired sequences that were successfully merged (forward and reverse read merged into one sequence). percentage of input merged: Percentage of input reads that passed the filtering, denoising, and merging steps. non-chimeric: Number of filtered, denoised, and merged sequences retained after chimera removal. This is the final number of sequences per sample. percentage of input non-chimeric: Percentage of input reads retained at the end. This visualisation is very useful to see where our sequences are being filtered. It is possible to be too stringent and not hae enough sequences for some samples. This will give you an idea on how you can repeat the denoising stats with changed options to retain more samples. Questions: In which DADA2 step were most of the sequences lost? If this was a real study would there be enough sequences left for optimal analysis? "],["10-Taxonomic_assignment.html", "Chapter 10 Assign a taxonomic classification to each amplicon sequence variant", " Chapter 10 Assign a taxonomic classification to each amplicon sequence variant Now that we have defined the sequence variants in the samples, we can assign taxonomic labels to them. Here, we use the sk-learn classifier to assign taxonomy based on the Greengenes database (DeSantis et al., 2006). Greengenes is a database containing quality-controlled microbial sequence data. Greengenes 16S rDNA sequences come from a large number of species which have been formatted for use in QIIME, by clustering the sequences at a given level of similarity (here, 99%). As for OTU-picking, the more stringent the similarity threshold, the more fine-grained the taxonomic designation (i.e. there are more Greengenes OTUs defined to the species level at 99% than at 97% similarity). The classifier maps the variant sequences to OTU representative sequences from the Greengenes set. First, we need to import the Greengenes data into QIIME2 artifacts. These steps will create two objects containing the sequences and their taxonomy, respectively. qiime tools import --input-path \\ /pub39/tea/matthew/16s_workshop/chapter_10/gg_13_8_otus/rep_set/99_otus.fasta \\ --output-path gg-13-8.99_otus.qza \\ --type &#39;FeatureData[Sequence]&#39; qiime tools import --input-path \\ /pub39/tea/matthew/16s_workshop/chapter_10/gg_13_8_otus/taxonomy/99_otu_taxonomy.txt \\ --output-path gg-13-8.99.taxa.qza \\ --input-format HeaderlessTSVTaxonomyFormat \\ --type &#39;FeatureData[Taxonomy]&#39; We require a classifier training step to reach optimum assignment performance.

Questions: What is the most abundant taxon, at taxonomic level 5, in the dataset (note: taxa are ordered form most to least abundant in the legend)? How do the samples compare to each other? If you have sequenced any samples with known composition (e.g. mock community), now is the time to see if they behave as expected, you may want to change some steps and/or settings of what you have done so far if the composition does not match what you expect. For example, change the de-noising tool or apply more quality filters to further improve the quality of the sequence under examination.

I.e. no column will be removed based on number of gaps. --p-min-conservation 0.4 This option is provided with a number from 0-1. This is the minimum relative frequency of at least one non-gap character (e.g. A,G,C,T) in a column for that column to be retained. 0.4 = A column will be retained if it contains at least one character that is present in at least 40% of the sequences.

"],["12-Rarefaction.html", "Chapter 12 Sequencing depth evaluation: rarefaction plot 12.1 Rarefaction command 12.2 Rarefaction visualisation", " Chapter 12 Sequencing depth evaluation: rarefaction plot The detected diversity partly depends on the sampling depths. An incompletely sampled community will appear less diverse than a fully sampled community. To compare the diversity between samples we need to account for their different sampling depths. This can be carried out with rarefaction. This is performed by reducing all the samples at the same sequence count, by random sub-sampling of the sequences. For example, if we rarefy to a depth of 2000 for all samples: Samples with depths of &lt;2000 will be removed. Samples with depths of 2000 will be unchanged. Samples with depths of &gt;2000 will have all reads removed except for a random subsample of 2000. Equally sized subsamples are directly comparable among different samples. Additionally, we can progressively sample smaller subsamples from a sample to draw a curve of estimated alpha diversity. The shape of this curve is informative. If the curve plateaus, then increased sampling depth will not increase the estimate of alpha diversity (the community is fully sampled). Example rarefaction curve: We can see that Series 1 plateaus at ~7,000 sequences and Series 3 plateaus at ~18,000 sequences whilst Series 2 has not started to plateau. 12.1 Rarefaction command Given an abundance table (and a phylogenetic tree for calculating phylogenetic distance), we can plot the rarefaction curve using different alpha-diversity metrics. Here, we will use diversity metrics (observed features, Simpson, Shannon, Faiths PD) as well as an evenness metric (Simpsons evenness). Note: See the appendix at the end of this bookdown for details on each metric. You may want to exclude --i-phylogeny rooted-tree.qza and --p-metrics faith_pd for markers such as ITS where you will not create a phylogenetic tree. qiime diversity alpha-rarefaction --i-table table-dada2.qza \\ --i-phylogeny rooted-tree.qza \\ # Min and max depth for the plot # These are based on your knowledge of the sample depths --p-min-depth 5000 \\ --p-max-depth 130000 \\ # Evaluating diversity every 500 sequence depth --p-steps 500 \\ # Using average from 10 iterations for the diversity count --p-iterations 10 \\ --m-metadata-file metadata.file.txt \\ --p-metrics simpson_e \\ --p-metrics simpson \\ --p-metrics shannon \\ --p-metrics observed_features \\ --p-metrics faith_pd \\ --o-visualization rarefaction-curve.qzv The command will take approximately 10 minutes. 12.2 Rarefaction visualisation Load the output visualisation artifact into QIIME2 view. You can select the alpha diversity Metric to visualise as well as the grouping (Sample Metadata Column, where each BarcodeSequence represents a sample). Generally the observed_features metric is the best Metric to view. The visualisation has two plots. Top plot = Alpha rarefaction plot. Primarily used to determine if the richness of the samples has been fully observed or sequenced. If the lines in the plot appear to plateau (i.e., becoming a horizontal line), this suggests that collecting additional sequences beyond that sampling depth will not effect the measured metric. E.g. a plateaued observed feature curve indicates there are no more feature to be detected. If the lines in the observed feature plot do not level out: The richness of the samples may have not been fully observed (because too few sequences were collected) Or it could be an indicator that a lot of sequencing errors remain in the data (which is being mistaken for novel diversity). Bottom plot = Number of samples (Y) against sequencing depth (x) This is important when grouping samples by metadata. It illustrates the number of samples with different sequencing depths for the groups in the chosen Sample Metadata Column. This is useful as when a samples sequencing depth is lower than the sequencing depth in the rarefaction plot it will no longer be considered in the rarefaction calculation. This can be seen as jitters in the rarefaction curve corresponding a decrease in number of samples. If the sample/s had a lower value than the average of the group the curve will jitter upwards, as the group average increases. If the sample/s had a higher value than the average of the group the curve will jitter downwards, as the group average decreases. Choosing a rarefaction threshold for the normalisation step, is ultimately identifying the best tradeoff between: Losing sequencing depth within samples. Losing entire samples. The best choice usually depends on the experimental design. If you have many samples per group you may be able to lose a few samples without losing statistical power for the analysis. If you have few samples per group you may need to choose a lower threshold. Other considerations for rarefaction threshold: Does the samples in one group have lower depths? Although you may be able to retain all the samples in the other groups with a high rarefaction threshold you may remove too much of the low depth group. Should you samples have relatively high (e.g. soil microbiomes) or low (e.g. human gut microbiome) diveristy. With higher diveristy you will need a larger rarefaction threshold Questions: Are any samples not fully sequenced? Comparing the two Locations, which has a higher evenness score (simpson_e)? Comparing the 2 Places, which has higher diversity value when considering most of the samples (faith_pd, shannon, &amp; simpson)? What sampling depth (rarefaction threshold) would you use for the alpha- and beta-diversity analysis? For the next step we will use a rarefaction size of 34,583. We have chosen this depth because: This will keep all the samples. The group based rarefaction curves (Location and Place) are plateauing at this depth. Many of the individual samples (BarcodeSequence) have plateaued with the others plateauing this depth. We do not have a lot of samples so we have prioritised keeping them rather than removing samples for a relatively small gain. How do we know that the very exact number of 34,583 will keep all the samples? Looking at the Interactive Sample Detail section of the table-dada2.qzv visualisation we can see that the lowest depth of a sample is 34,583 (3K1E). Generally people will use the depth of a sample as the rarefaction threshold. E.g. if we were going to choose a rarefaction threshold of &gt;50k wed pick 58,605 as the exact threshold as that is the lowest sample depth &gt;50k (from sample 1K2M). This allows us to use the maximum amount of sequences per sample. "],["13-Diversity_analysis.html", "Chapter 13 Diversity analysis", " Chapter 13 Diversity analysis Alpha diversity is a representation of the diversity within a sample. There are many possible metrics for estimating alpha diversity (QIIME2 allows 30 metrics to be estimated), including the Shannon metric, the number of observed features and Faiths phylogenetic distance (Shannon, 1948, Faith, 1992). Beta diversity is diversity among different communities. There are many possible metrics to represent the distance among samples (QIIME2 allows 34 to be estimated). We will use weighted and unweighted UniFrac metrics (Lozupone and Knight, 2005, Lozupoune et al., 2007) and the Bray-Curtis metric (Bray and Curtis, 1957) (More info on these mertics in the appendix). QIIME2 includes a wrapper script to co-investigate alpha- and beta-diversity at the same time. This script includes only a selected list of alpha- and beta-diversity metrics, but are usually enough to investigate the dataset. It is possible to use different metrics using the single scripts for alpha and beta-diversity (https://docs.qiime2.org/2019.1/plugins/available/diversity/). qiime diversity core-metrics-phylogenetic \\ --i-table table-dada2.qza \\ --i-phylogeny rooted-tree.qza \\ # Chosen final sampling depth --p-sampling-depth 34583 \\ --output-dir dada2-diversity-34583 \\ --m-metadata-file metadata.file.txt This command will produce all the results within the directory specified with the --output-dir. The artifact rarefied_table.qza is the abundance table normalised by rarefaction at the specified sampling size. The output directory contains the artefact for each used diversity metrics (for alpha- and beta-diversity). The beta-diversity ordination plots are also included in visualisation objects (emperor.qzv files). In case of ITS or any marker for which it is not possible to obtain phylogenetic tree, the alternative command to use for the diversity analysis is: qiime diversity core-metrics, which lacks the --i-phylogeny options. Questions: Looking at the beta-diversity plot, one metrics of your choice, is there any metadata category reflecting the distribution of the samples in the plot? If you choose a different metric, do you get a different plot/results? Does a different sampling-depth does give a different result? Considering the alpha-diversity results for each metric, we need to explore if there is a group (within the metadata category) showing a higher diversity than the other groups, with a statistical significance and not by chance given the high number of data we are dealing with. The QIIME2 pipeline offers two alternative choices: for categorical or numerical metadata. In the first case a Kruskall-Wallis test will be used to compare the alpha-diversity distribution among the groups within the specified metadata category; in the second case, a ranked Spearman test will be used instead. cd dada2-diversity-34583 # For the Kruskal-Wallis qiime diversity alpha-group-significance \\ --i-alpha-diversity shannon_vector.qza \\ --m-metadata-file ../metadata.file.txt \\ --o-visualization shannon-group-significance.kw.qzv # For the ranked Spearman qiime diversity alpha-correlation \\ --i-alpha-diversity shannon_vector.qza \\ --m-metadata-file ../metadata.file.txt \\ --o-visualization shannon-group-significance.rs.qzv Both scripts should finish within a few seconds, giving a visualisation artifact including plots and statistical results. Questions: Is there any category (for one or more metadata category) showing a higher/lower alpha-diversity compared with the other? Is the p-value for this comparison significant (all the pvalues are corrected for false-discovery rate)? If you choose a different metric do you get different results? (Please look at both the Kruskal-Wallis and Ranked Spearman results!) Having identified a metadata category (co-variate) that potentially explain the distribution in the beta-diversity ordination plot obtained using a specific metric, it is now important to investigate, again, if that separation has a statistical significance or if it may have just be originated by chance. We will use the permanova test (you can choose anosim as alternative) to compare the grouping for a specific metadata category with the obtained distance metrics (at 999 permutations). qiime diversity beta-group-significance \\ --i-distance-matrix weighted_unifrac_distance_matrix.qza \\ --m-metadata-file ../metadata.file.txt \\ # Select one specific metadata column --m-metadata-column Location \\ # prmanova default, anosim as alternative choice --p-method permanova \\ --p-pairwise \\ --p-permutations 999 \\ --o-visualization weighted-unifrac-significance.location.qzv The script should finish within a few seconds, giving a visualisation artifact including plots and statistical results. Questions: Does the chosen grouping information result in statistical differences between two or more groups (as before the p-values are corrected for false-discovery rate)? Does using anosim instead of permanova change the result? And using a different ordination metric? What about choosing a different grouping (metadata category)?

Are there any missing taxa you know should be there? These taxa may be present but not being detected for a few reasons, first of all, are these represented in the taxonomical database you are using? If no, you should try with a different one (Greengenes or Silva). If they are, you can try with different taxonomical assignment methods. If this still does not work, you can change the method to pick up the representative sequence and/or the clustering at the earlier stages of the analysis. The failure could also be right at the beginning of the project design. It is worth checking if the PCR primers you are using can amplify these species.

Generally a higher value of these indexes/measures indicates higher diversity/evenness. 17.1.1 Observed features The observed number of features is defined as the number of distinct features, such as ASVs, within a sample. The number of observed features can also be known as the feature richness of a sample. A sample with more present features than another would be said to be richer. 17.1.2 Evenness How evenly spread the abundances are across all present features. A sample with 4 ASVs, each with 25% relative abundance would be perfectly even. A sample with 4 ASVs, where one ASV has 97% abundance and the other 3 have 1%, would be highly uneven. 17.1.3 Faiths PD (phylogenetic diversity) Faiths PD represents the minimum total branch length that covers all taxa within the sample on a phylogenetic tree (Faith, 1992). A smaller PD value indicates a reduced expected taxonomic diversity whilst a large PD value indicates a higher expected diversity. A sample with 10 ASVs could have a lower Faiths PD than a sample with only 2 ASVs. This could occur if the 10 ASV sample only has ASVs from one genus whilst the 2 ASV samples consists of ASVs from 2 different Families. 17.1.4 Simpson A measure of diversity based on number of features present and the relative abundance of each feature. If richness and evenness increase the diversity score increases. Equation: \\[ D = 1 - {( \\frac {\\sum n{(n-1)}} {N{(N-1)}} )} \\] D = Simpson diversity index n = Abundance of feature N = Total feature abundance of sample The values range from 0 (no diversity) to 1 (infinite diversity). 17.1.5 Simpson evenness measure (simpson_e) This is a measure of evenness based on the Simpson index. It ranges from 0 (lowest eveness) to 1 (complete evenness). It compares the calculated Simpson Index of a sample to its theoretical maximum if the sample was perfectly even but had the same amount of features. Equation: \\[ E_D = \\frac{D} {D_m} \\] ED = Simpson evenness measure D = Simpson diversity index Dm = Max possible Simpson diveristy index given the number of features 17.1.6 Shannon A measure of diversity where a higher number means higher diversity. Shannons index accounts for both abundance and evenness of the feaures present. Equation: \\[ H = -\\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i lnp_i \\] H = Shannon diversity index p = n/N n = Abundance of feature N = Total feature abundance of sample 17.2 Beta diversity metrics Beta diversity compares 2 samples at a time. This is measured in terms of dissimilarity: A lower score indicate the 2 samples are more similar. A higher score indicates the 2 samples are more dissimilar. 17.2.1 Weighted and unweighted UniFrac distances The UniFrac metric is a phylogenetic distance measure between two samples. It is defined as the sum of the unshared branch lengths between two samples divided by the total branch length (shared + unshared) of two samples (Lozupone and Knight, 2005). This results in calculating the fraction of the branch lengths unique to each sample (ie. the higher this value is, the more dissimilar two samples are). The entire phylogenetic tree created for all the sequences of all the analysed samples is used for this calculation. Unweighted UniFrac: Only considers feature presence/absence. Weighted UniFrac: Takes into account feature presence/absence &amp; abundance. I.e. the value is weighted by the abundances. 17.2.2 Bray-Curtis The Bray-Curtis metric is a dissimilarity measure that can quantify the level of difference between two samples. Two identical samples would have a Bray-Curtis measure of 0 (i.e. they have 0 dissimilarity). There are 2 versions but the one used by QIIME2 looks at the number of features shared by the 2 samples. Equation: \\[ CBC = 1  (\\frac{2c} {a + b}) \\] c = # features present in both samples a = # features present in sample a b = # features present in sample b 17.3 Diversity Resources For more diveristy measure please see: https://forum.qiime2.org/t/alpha-and-beta-diversity-explanations-and-commands/2282 "]]
