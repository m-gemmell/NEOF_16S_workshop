# (PART\*) Preprocessing of data {-}

# Sequence import {#import}
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/import.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
``` 

Before we can work with our data in QIIME2 we need to import the data into a QIIME2 artifact.

## Import: run
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '15%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/play_green.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
``` 

Import our read pairs into a QIIME2 artifact.

__Note__: It is quite easy to make typos in the following command. Ensure to read any errors carefully to try to figure out where a typo is, if any.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
qiime tools import \
--type 'SampleData[PairedEndSequencesWithQuality]' \
--input-path PairedEndFastqManifestPhred33.csv \
--output-path paired-end-demux.qza \
--input-format PairedEndFastqManifestPhred33
```

#### Parameters {-}
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '10%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/parameter_green.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

- __`--type`__: The type of data being imported.
  - `'SampleData[PairedEndSequencesWithQuality]'` specifies we are importing Paired end sequence data that contain quality. I.e. normal Illumina paired end fastq data.
- __`--input-path`__: The input [manifest file](#manifestfile)
- __`--output-path`__: Output QIIME2 artifact file containing your sequence data.
  - The "demux" part of the file name indicates that the samples are already demultiplexed (i.e. sequences have been separated by samples). 
  - QIIME2 artifacts use "-" as word separators in file names.  This is not mandatory but it is a good practice to keep consistent with the QIIME2 developers.
- __`--input-format`__: The format of the input files.
  - `PairedEndFastqManifestPhred33`: Our input file is a Manifest file with information on paired fastq files. Our fastq files have quality encoding of Phred33, the most commonly used for Illumina data now. More information about fastq quality encoding can be found on [wikipedia](#https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format#Encoding).
 
[QIIME2 docs on importing data](https://docs.qiime2.org/2022.2/tutorials/importing/)

__Note__: All the QIIME2 links may be out of date and the below will appear:
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '100%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/qiime2_website_out_of_date.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
``` 

If this occurs click "Show me the content on this page".

You can then click the version box on the top left (above the table of contents, pictured below) and choose the version you would like. This would be either the version you are using or the latest version.
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/qiime2_version_box.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
``` 

## Import: visualise {#chap7_vis}
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/eye_green.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
``` 

To visualise the samples loaded, the following command will create a visualisation artifact.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
qiime demux summarize \
--i-data paired-end-demux.qza \
--o-visualization paired-end-demux.qzv
```

#### Parameters {-}
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '10%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/parameter_green.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

- __`--i-data`__: Input data artifact (`.qza`) to be summarised and visualised.
- __`--o-visualization`__: Output visualisation artifact (`qzv`).

[QIIME2 docs on `qiime demux summarize`](https://docs.qiime2.org/2022.2/plugins/available/demux/summarize/)

#### Chrome {-}
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '10%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/chrome.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

This next step is important! Make sure to open a new terminal and open chrome in it. Keep this terminal and chrome open (To open a new terminal, right click on the main screen, choose `Applications` -> `Shell` -> `bash`). Opening and closing chrome multiple times has proven to cause issues in past workshops. To open the browser ‘chrome’, run the following command in your new terminal:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
chrome.sh
```

From now on leave the terminal you ran the above command on alone and don't close chrome.

Then:

- Navigate to the following web-site on chrome: ‘view.qiime2.org’
- Click on the ‘Drag and drop or click here’ grey box
- You can browse now to find and select the file ‘paired-end-demux.qzv’. 

__Tip__: click "HOME" on the top right, from there you can navigate to "Metagenetics" and choose your file.

#### Output {-#chap7output}
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '10%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/output_file_green.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

The visualisation will have two tabs:

1. __Overview__: This contains 3 main sections relating to the sequence count of samples.
   - __Demultiplexxed sequence counts summary__: Summary table of number of sequences per sample divided by forward and reverse reads.
   - __Read frequency histograms__: Forward and Reverse reads histograms showing the how many samples have various numbers of sequences. 
   - __Per-sample sequence counts__: Table showing the number of forward and reverse reads in samples.
2. __Interactive Quality Plots__: Contains similar information as fastQC analysis.
   - __Interactive quality plots__: These show the quality of your forward and reverse reads using a random sampling of 10000 reads. You can click on a part of the plot to get info in the below "Parametric seven-number summary" table.
   - __Demultiplexed sequence length summary__: Table showing summary of sequence lengths for the forward and reverse reads.

## Import: MCQs
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '15%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/question_bubble_green.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
opts_p <- c(answer="__42,853__", "__126,670__", "__174,951__")
```
1. What is the minimum number of forward reads across the samples? `r longmcq(opts_p)`

```{r, echo = FALSE}
opts_p <- c("__42,853__", "__126,670__", answer="__174,951__")
```
2. What is the maximum number of forward reads across the samples? `r longmcq(opts_p)`

```{r, echo = FALSE}
opts_p <- c("__42,853__", answer="__126,670__", "__174,951__")
```
3. What is the mean number of forward reads across the samples? `r longmcq(opts_p)`

```{r, echo = FALSE}
opts_p <- c("__1TM__", "__3K2E__", answer="__3K1M__")
```
4. Which sample has 134,737 forward reads? `r longmcq(opts_p)`
 
```{r, echo = FALSE}
opts_p <- c(answer="__1TM__", "__3K2E__", "__3K1M__")
```
5. Which sample has 86,083 forward reads? `r longmcq(opts_p)`

```{r, echo = FALSE}
opts_p <- c(answer="__TRUE__", "__FALSE__")
```
6. Most of the read quality for the forward reads is above Q30? `r longmcq(opts_p)`

```{r, echo = FALSE}
opts_p <- c(answer="__TRUE__", "__FALSE__")
```
7. Most of the read quality for the reverse reads is above Q30? `r longmcq(opts_p)`

## Import: summary
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '15%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/sum_green.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

We have imported our read data and checked the number of reads per sample which looks good. The next step is to remove data from the sequence data we do not need any more.
