# Differential abundance analysis

The ANCOM method aims to identify the differentially abundant taxa. It  is a complex method requiring different steps, for the description of the script used please refer to the script page (https://docs.qiime2.org/2019.1/plugins/available/composition/ancom/) and the ANCOM paper (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26028277) .

The steps to carry this out are:

1. Collapse the ASVs into taxa
2. Add pseudo-count to the abundance table to convert ‘0’ to ‘1’
3. Run ANCOM selecting a categorical metadata to test

If you are still in ‘dada2-diversity-34583’ directory, please remember to move out:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
cd ..
```

First, we need to collapse the ASVs into taxa. This is done as seeing which ASVs are differentially abundant with no taxonomic information is not very useful. Let us choose greengenes level 5 which equates to family.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
qiime taxa collapse \
--i-table table-dada2.qza \
--i-taxonomy taxonomy.sklearn.qza \
--p-level 5 \
--o-collapsed-table comp-ancom-table-l5.qza
```

Add pseudo-count to the abundance table with the purpose of converting 0s to 1s. This is required as ANCOM will fail with abundance values of 0.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
qiime composition add-pseudocount \
--i-table comp-ancom-table-l5.qza \
--p-pseudocount 1 \
--o-composition-table comp-ancom-table-l5-pse.qza
```

Finally, we run ANCOM. In this instance we will use Location as the metadata so we can find biomarkers that differentiate between Corridor and Toilet.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
qiime composition ancom \
--i-table comp-ancom-table-l5-pse.qza \
--m-metadata-file metadata.file.txt \
--m-metadata-column Location \
--o-visualization l5-ancom-Location.qzv
```

This produces a visualistion file with the following sections:

- __ANCOM Volcano Plot__: A dot plot of the W statistic (y) against the CLR (x).
   - Each dot represents a feature (family in this case) in the dataset.
   - W statistic: The higher this value the more significant the feature is differentially abundant between groups.
   - CLR (centred log ratio): In practical terms this is how different the abundance of the feature is between the metadata groups in terms of log-fold change. The further the value is from 0 the more different the abudance.
- __ANCOM statistical results__: This shows the name and W statistic of features found to be differentially abundant.
   - ANCOM automatically chooses a W statistic threshold for significance.
- __Percentile abundances of features by group__: This is a table which can be thought of as containing the text version of a boxplot. This shows the abundances of the differentially abundant features for the different groups.


__Questions__: 

+ Which families are discovered as biomarkers? 
+ Investigating these families, does this make sense? 
+ Run ANCOM analysis for genus level (level 6). Do you get any genera as biomarkers that do not belong to families discovered as biomarkers? 
+ Does changing the metadata category let you infer something different?
