# Beta diversity statistical analysis
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '15%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/beta_div.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
``` 

Next we can carry out statistical analysis of the beta diversity ordination plots. We will carry out a 'PERMANOVA' analysis to determine if the separation of samples by metadata groups has statistical significance or if it may have just originated by chance. 

To carry this out the 'PERMANOVA' analysis we will use the `distance_matrix.qza` which contains all the sample pairwise dissimilarity distances. For the `--p-permutations` option we will use the default value, 999.

The 'Location' metadata column with the weighted UniFrac metric will be used as there appeared to be a separation between the Corridor and Toilet samples, especially on Axis 2.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
qiime diversity beta-group-significance \
--i-distance-matrix weighted_unifrac_distance_matrix.qza \
--m-metadata-file ../metadata.file.txt \
--m-metadata-column Location \
# prmanova default, anosim as alternative choice
--p-method permanova \
--p-pairwise \
--p-permutations 999 \
--o-visualization weighted-unifrac-significance.location.qzv
```

Load the resulting visualisation file in QIIME2 view. You will see the following sections:

- __Overview__: An overview of the statistical analysis for the metadata column.
- __Group significance plot__: These boxplots represent all the pairwise distances between the samples in the specified groups.
   - Distances to Corridor plot
      - Corridor boxplot: This boxplot represents all the pairwise distances within the Corridor samples. If you had 3 corridor samples (C1-3) the boxplot would consist of the distances between C1-C2, C1-C3, and C2-C3.
      - Toilet boxplot: This boxplot represents the pairwise distances between all the corridor samples and toilet samples. If you had 3 corridor samples (C1-3) and 2 toilet samples (T1-2) the boxplot would consist of the distances between C1-T1, C1-T2, C2-T1, C2-T2, C3-T1, and C3-T2.
   - With these plots you can see if the distances within a group is lower than the distances between that group and other groups.
- __Pairwise results__: This section shows the statistical results comparing the different groups in pairwise fashion. The best values to look at are:
   - Sample size: Good to determine if there are enough samples for statistical strength.
   - q-value: Always go for q-values over p-values.

__Questions__:

+ Does the chosen grouping information result in a statistically significant difference? 
+ Does using ‘anosim’ instead of ‘permanova’ change the result? 
+ And using a different ordination metric? 
+ What about choosing a different grouping (metadata category)?
