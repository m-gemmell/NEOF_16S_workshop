# Beta diversity statistical analysis {#beta_stats}
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '15%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/beta_div.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
``` 

We'll now carry out statistical analysis of the beta diversity ordination plots. We'll use 'PERMANOVA' analysis to determine if the separation of samples by metadata groups has statistical significance or if it may have just originated by chance.

## Beta diveristy: PCoA
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '15%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/Scatterplot_2.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
``` 

Before running some statistical analysis let's look at one of the PCoA plots created in the the [`qiime diversity core-metrics-phylogenetic`](#diversity) command.

1. Open the file `weighted_uinifrac_emperor.qzv` in QIIME2 view.
2. Set the __"Select a Color Category"__ drop down to __"Location"__.
3. Clicking and dragging on the plot, manipulate your view of the 3-D plot until you separate the __"Corridor"__ and __"Toilet"__ samples.

We are able to visually separate these two groups in the plot, especially on Axis 2. However, will some statistics back this up?

## Beta diversity: run 
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '15%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/play_green.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
``` 

To carry this out our first 'PERMANOVA' analysis we will use the `weighted_unifrac_distance_matrix.qza` file. It contains all the sample pairwise weighted unifrac dissimilarity distances.

The 'Location' metadata column with the weighted UniFrac metric will be used as there appeared to be a separation between the Corridor and Toilet samples.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
qiime diversity beta-group-significance \
--i-distance-matrix weighted_unifrac_distance_matrix.qza \
--m-metadata-file ../metadata.file.txt \
--m-metadata-column Location \
--p-method permanova \
--p-pairwise \
--p-permutations 999 \
--o-visualization weighted-unifrac-significance.location.qzv
```

#### Parameters {-}
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '10%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/parameter_green.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

- __`--i-distance-matrix`__: Input artifact files containing the beta diversity values.
- __`--m-metadata-file`__: [Metadata file](#metadata.file.txt) for our samples.
- __`--m-metadata-column`__: Metadata column within the metadata file to use for the statistical comparison.
- __`--p-method`__: The group significance test to be applied.
  - `permanova` is the default. `anosim` and `permdisp` are the other 2 options.
- __`--p-pairwise`__: This means all pairwise tests between all pairs of groups in addition to the test across all groups will be carried out.
  - The other parameter choice is `--p-no-pairwise` meaning only the test across all groups will be carried out. This can be used if their are a lot of groups in the metadata column that may make the command take too long to run.
- __`--p-permutations`__: The number of permutations to run when computing p-values.
  - The default is `999`.
__`--o-visualization`__: The output artifact containing the visualisation.

## Beta diversity: visualise
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '15%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/eye_green.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

Load the resulting visualisation (`weighted-unifrac-significance.location.qzv`) file in QIIME2 view. You will see the following sections:

- __Overview__: An overview of the statistical analysis for the metadata column.
- __Group significance plot__: These boxplots represent all the pairwise distances between the samples in the specified groups.
   - Distances to Corridor plot
      - Corridor boxplot: This boxplot represents all the pairwise distances within the Corridor samples. If you had 3 corridor samples (C1-3) the boxplot would consist of the distances between C1-C2, C1-C3, and C2-C3.
      - Toilet boxplot: This boxplot represents the pairwise distances between all the corridor samples and toilet samples. If you had 3 corridor samples (C1-3) and 2 toilet samples (T1-2) the boxplot would consist of the distances between C1-T1, C1-T2, C2-T1, C2-T2, C3-T1, and C3-T2.
   - With these plots you can see if the distances within a group is lower than the distances between that group and other groups.
- __Pairwise results__: This section shows the statistical results comparing the different groups in pairwise fashion. The best values to look at are:
   - Sample size: Good to determine if there are enough samples for statistical strength.
   - q-value: Always go for q-values over p-values.

__Questions__:

+ Does the chosen grouping information result in a statistically significant difference? 
+ Does using ‘anosim’ instead of ‘permanova’ change the result? 
+ And using a different ordination metric? 
+ What about choosing a different grouping (metadata category)?
