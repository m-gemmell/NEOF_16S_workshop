# Differential abundance analysis
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '30%', echo=FALSE }

``` 

The ANCOM method to identify the differentially abundant taxa, is a complex method requiring different steps, for the description of the script used please refer to the script page (https://docs.qiime2.org/2019.1/plugins/available/composition/ancom/) and the ANCOM paper (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26028277) .

The steps to carry this out are:

1. Collapse ASVs into taxa-bar-plots
2. Add pseudo-count to the abundance table to convert ‘0’ to ‘1’
3. Run ANCOM selecting a categorical metadata to test

If you are still in ‘dada2-diversity-30000’ folder, please remember to move out:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
cd ..
```

First, we need to collapse the ASVs into taxa. This is done as seeing which ASVs are differentially abundant with no taxonomic information is not very useful. Let us choose greengenes level 5 which equates to family.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
qiime taxa collapse \
--i-table table-dada2.qza \
--i-taxonomy taxonomy.sklearn.qza \
--p-level 5 \
--o-collapsed-table comp-ancom-table-l5.qza
```

Add pseudo-count to the abundance table to convert ‘0’ to ‘1’. This is required as ANCOM will fail with abundance values of 0.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
qiime composition add-pseudocount \
--i-table comp-ancom-table-l5.qza \
--p-pseudocount 1 \
--o-composition-table comp-ancom-table-l5-pse.qza
```

Finally, we run ANCOM. In this instance we will use Location as the metadata so we can find biomarkers that differentiate between StudentCorridor, StudentHome, Corridor and Toilet.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
qiime composition ancom \
--i-table comp-ancom-table-l5-pse.qza \
--m-metadata-file metadata.file.txt \
--m-metadata-column Location \
--o-visualization l5-ancom-Location.qzv
```

__Questions__: 

+ Which families are discovered as biomarkers? 
+ Investigating these families, does this make sense? 
+ Do you get any genera as biomarkers that do not belong to families discovered as biomarkers? 
+ Does changing the metadata category let you infer something different?
